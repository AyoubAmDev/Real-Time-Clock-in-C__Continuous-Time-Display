# Real-Time-Clock-in-C__Continuous-Time-Display
This project is a simple implementation of a real-time clock using the C programming language. It allows users to set the initial time (hours, minutes, and seconds) and then continuously displays the time in a loop, simulating a clock ticking. The program includes error handling for invalid input and utilizes the sleep() function to slow down the loop, providing a more realistic clock experience.
